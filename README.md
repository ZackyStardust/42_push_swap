# 42_push_swap
A sorting algorithm that works with a fixed set of commands. Done as a part of the 42 curriculum.
The algorithm used was Binary Radix.

To run it, go into the terminal and first use ```make```. Then, run the program with followed by a list of random numbers. Example: ```./push_swap 8 98 54 12 0 4887 985```. The program should display a list of the commands used to perfectly sort the stack a using a stack b as support.

NOTE: Using strings, repeated numbers or numbers higher than MAX_INT (or lower than MAX_INT) will result in an error.

A better description will be added shortly, including the list of what does each command do.
